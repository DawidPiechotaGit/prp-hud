### prp-hud

Ultra customizable hud featuring a unique and robust settings menu. Change eveything about your experience!

### Optional:

- [ps-buffs](https://github.com/Project-Sloth/ps-buffs)

### ⚠️Important:

- **If the minimap is pulsating or flickering, make sure if you are using custom maps that you ensure prp-hud BEFORE map resource.**
- **Do not rename this resource from prp-hud or you will encounter issues.**
- Locale is now supported. Make sure that your qb-core is update. You can update it [here](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core).
- **This script is fully open source, it has no obfuscation.** Svelte compiled the js when it gets build and original source code is here [svelte-source](https://github.com/Project-Sloth/ps-hud/tree/main/svelte-source).
